1. Introduction – Project Overview and Understanding

The goal of the Solar Challenge Week 1 project is to set up a reliable and collaborative workflow for data science tasks. This involves using Git for version control and creating a consistent development environment. The main task was to create a GitHub repository with all the essential project folders and files, along with continuous integration (CI) to automatically check code quality. By building this foundation first, the team can work together smoothly and ensure everything is ready for future data analysis.

2. Methodology – Process, Progress So Far, and Results
   Repository Setup:
   Created a GitHub repository named solar-challenge-week1.

Cloned the repository locally and initialized a Python virtual environment using venv.

Branching and Commits:
Created a feature branch named setup-task.

Made and pushed multiple commits including:

init: add .gitignore – added rules to ignore data, checkpoints, and environments.

chore: venv setup – added requirements.txt with dependencies.

ci: add GitHub Actions workflow – set up basic CI.

CI/CD Integration:
Created a .github/workflows/ci.yml file to run:
name: CI

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
build:
runs-on: ubuntu-latest
steps: - uses: actions/checkout@v3 - name: Set up Python
uses: actions/setup-python@v4
with:
python-version: '3.11' - name: Install dependencies
run: pip install -r requirements.txt

This is a cicd which will run on push and pull requests. here first it will use the action/checkout@v3 to setup python and then install
the requirements.tsx to install the packages.

Documentation:
Wrote a README.md outlining steps to reproduce the environment using python -m venv and installing requirements via pip install -r requirements.txt.

Merging:
Created and merged a pull request from setup-task to main.

3. Challenges & Solutions
   Git Ignore Conflicts: Early pushes included large data files. Resolved by refining .gitignore to exclude data/, .ipynb_checkpoints/, and virtual environments.

Workflow YAML Error: Faced an issue with incorrect syntax in the GitHub Actions file. Solved by referring to official GitHub Actions documentation and correcting indentation and job steps.

Virtual Environment Consistency: Addressed machine-specific path issues by providing clear setup instructions in the README and locking versions in requirements.txt.

4. Future Plan – What’s Left and How to Finish
   Data Collection & Cleaning: In the next phase, raw solar data will be ingested and cleaned using pandas.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Generate insights from the data with visualizations.


5. Conclusion – Summary of Current Progress and Confidence Going Forward
   So far, the foundational work of setting up the project repository, environment, CI workflow, and folder structure has been completed successfully. All changes were committed incrementally and merged following good Git practices. This setup ensures team members can now focus on data-driven tasks with confidence in the project’s reproducibility and maintainability.
